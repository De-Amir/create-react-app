# Create React App [![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/facebook/create-react-app/_apis/build/status/facebook.create-react-app?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/facebook/create-react-app/_build/latest?definitionId=1&branchName=master) [![PRs Welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-welcome-green.svg)](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/pulls)

Create React apps with no build configuration.

- [User Guide](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/) – How to develop apps bootstrapped with Create React App.

Create React App works on macOS, Windows, and Linux.<br>
If something doesn’t work, please [file an issue](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/new).

## Quick Overview

```sh
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start
```

_([npx](https://medium.com/@maybekatz/introducing-npx-an-npm-package-runner-55f7d4bd282b) comes with npm 5.2+ and higher, see [instructions for older npm versions](https://gist.github.com/gaearon/4064d3c23a77c74a3614c498a8bb1c5f))_

Then open [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) to see your app.<br>
When you’re ready to deploy to production, create a minified bundle with `npm run build`.

### Get Started Immediately

You **don’t** need to install or configure tools like Webpack or Babel.<br>
They are preconfigured and hidden so that you can focus on the code.

Just create a project, and you’re good to go.

Here are a few common cases where you might want to try something else:

- If you want to **try React** without hundreds of transitive build tool dependencies, consider [using a single HTML file or an online sandbox instead](https://reactjs.org/docs/try-react.html).

- If you need to **integrate React code with a server-side template framework** like Rails, Django or Symfony, or if you’re **not building a single-page app**, consider using [nwb](https://github.com/insin/nwb), or [Neutrino](https://neutrino.js.org/) which are more flexible. For Rails specifically, you can use [Rails Webpacker](https://github.com/rails/webpacker). For Symfony, try [Symfony's Webpack Encore](https://symfony.com/doc/current/frontend/encore/reactjs.html).

- If you need to **publish a React component**, [nwb](https://github.com/insin/nwb) can [also do this](https://github.com/insin/nwb#react-components-and-libraries), as well as [Neutrino's react-components preset](https://neutrino.js.org/packages/react-components/).

- If you want to do **server rendering** with React and Node.js, check out [Next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/) or [Razzle](https://github.com/jaredpalmer/razzle). Create React App is agnostic of the backend, and just produces static HTML/JS/CSS bundles.

- If your website is **mostly static** (for example, a portfolio or a blog), consider using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) instead. Unlike Create React App, it pre-renders the website into HTML at the build time.

- Finally, if you need **more customization**, check out [Neutrino](https://neutrino.js.org/) and its [React preset](https://neutrino.js.org/packages/react/).

All of the above tools can work with little to no configuration.

If you prefer configuring the build yourself, [follow this guide](https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-an-existing-app.html).
